Homeworks

I will collect your home assignment solutions through private github repositories that you need to create (see the instructions from the 1st homework). If you haven't done so yet, please give us the info about your homework repository through the google form (see the main pinned message in the telegram chat).

# Exam project guidelines

As mentioned in the [course overview](Week_1/Python_2024_CourseOverview_Intro.pdf),
there are two options for the exam project: participating in a competition (on www.kaggle.com or similar).
**Please add your choice to the table I provided on our group chat.

There are 3 main checkpoints for the project:
|Checkpoint|Soft deadline|Hard deadline|
|--|--|--|
|Topic choice| Mar 14 | Mar 28|
|Intermediate status report|Apr 25|May 16|
|Project defense|May 23| Official exam date|

- Meeting any of the soft deadlines gives you a +0.5 bonus for the exam score, each.
- Missing any of the hard deadlines gives you a â€“0.5 penalty for the exam score, each.

Topic choice needs to be approved, so make sure you leave some time before the deadline for possible refinements.

Intermediate status report should cover at least 50% of the work that will be done by the project defense.
This intermediate report should consist of a github repository with your code, where your
**continuous progress should be clearly seen** (if you're participating in a competition within a team,
**contributions from all the members should be seen explicitly, via commits**).
Also, a brief supporting document should be provided (e.g. text or slides with comments) describing what
you have done and what you are planning to do by the end of the project.
The report will be graded in a binary form (passed/failed).

The project defense will be organized in a form of a public presentation of roughly 10-15 minutes per person (team).
A successfully passed intermediate status report is necessary to be admitted for the project defense.
