    "## What are artifacts?\n",
    "\n",
    "Artifacts are parts of the recorded signal that arise from sources other than\n",
    "the source of interest (i.e., neuronal activity in the brain). As such,\n",
    "artifacts are a form of interference or noise relative to the signal of\n",
    "interest. There are many possible causes of such interference, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Environmental artifacts\n",
    "    - Persistent oscillations centered around the `AC power line frequency`_\n",
    "      (typically 50 or 60 Hz)\n",
    "    - Brief signal jumps due to building vibration (such as a door slamming)\n",
    "    - Electromagnetic field noise from nearby elevators, cell phones, the\n",
    "      geomagnetic field, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instrumentation artifacts\n",
    "    - Electromagnetic interference from stimulus presentation (such as EEG\n",
    "      sensors picking up the field generated by unshielded headphones)\n",
    "    - Continuous oscillations at specific frequencies used by head position\n",
    "      indicator (HPI) coils\n",
    "    - Random high-amplitude fluctuations (or alternatively, constant zero\n",
    "      signal) in a single channel due to sensor malfunction (e.g., in surface\n",
    "      electrodes, poor scalp contact)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Biological artifacts\n",
    "    - Periodic `QRS`_-like signal patterns (especially in magnetometer\n",
    "      channels) due to electrical activity of the heart\n",
    "    - Short step-like deflections (especially in frontal EEG channels) due to\n",
    "      eye movements\n",
    "    - Large transient deflections (especially in frontal EEG channels) due to\n",
    "      blinking\n",
    "    - Brief bursts of high frequency fluctuations across several channels due\n",
    "      to the muscular activity during swallowing\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some cases where signals from within the brain can be\n",
    "considered artifactual. For example, if a researcher is primarily interested\n",
    "in the sensory response to a stimulus, but the experimental paradigm involves\n",
    "a behavioral response (such as button press), the neural activity associated\n",
    "with the planning and executing the button press could be considered an\n",
    "artifact relative to signal of interest (i.e., the evoked sensory response).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Artifacts of the same genesis may appear different in recordings made by\n",
    "    different EEG or MEG systems, due to differences in sensor design (e.g.,\n",
    "    passive vs. active EEG electrodes; axial vs. planar gradiometers, etc).</p></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to do about artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 basic options when faced with artifacts in your recordings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Ignore* the artifact and carry on with analysis\n",
    "2. *Exclude* the corrupted portion of the data and analyze the remaining data\n",
    "3. *Repair* the artifact by suppressing artifactual part of the recording\n",
    "   while (hopefully) leaving the signal of interest intact\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different approaches to repairing artifacts, and MNE-Python\n",
    "includes a variety of tools for artifact repair, including digital filtering,\n",
    "independent components analysis (ICA), Maxwell filtering / signal-space\n",
    "separation (SSS), and signal-space projection (SSP). Separate tutorials\n",
    "demonstrate each of these techniques for artifact repair. Many of the\n",
    "artifact repair techniques work on both continuous (raw) data and on data\n",
    "that has already been epoched (though not necessarily equally well); some can\n",
    "be applied to `memory-mapped`_ data while others require the data to be\n",
    "copied into RAM. Of course, before you can choose any of these strategies you\n",
    "must first *detect* the artifacts, which is the topic of the next section.\n",

    "## Artifact detection\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why mark bad channels at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many analysis computations can be strongly affected by the presence of bad\n",
    "channels. For example, a malfunctioning channel with completely flat signal\n",
    "will have zero channel variance, which will cause noise estimates to be\n",
    "unrealistically low. This low noise estimate will lead to a strong channel\n",
    "weight in the estimate of cortical current, and because the channel is flat,\n",
    "the magnitude of cortical current estimates will shrink dramatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, very noisy channels can also cause problems. For example, they\n",
    "can lead to too many epochs being discarded based on signal amplitude\n",
    "rejection thresholds, which in turn can lead to less robust estimation of the\n",
    "noise covariance across sensors. Noisy channels can also interfere with\n",
    ":term:`SSP` computations, because the projectors will be\n",
    "spatially biased in the direction of the noisy channel, which can cause\n",
    "adjacent good channels to be suppressed. ICA is corrupted by noisy channels\n",
    "for similar reasons. On the other hand, when performing machine learning\n",
    "analyses, bad channels may have limited, if any impact (i.e., bad channels\n",
    "will be uninformative and therefore ignored / deweighted by the algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpolating bad channels\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases simply excluding bad channels is sufficient (for example, if\n",
    "you plan only to analyze a specific sensor ROI, and the bad channel is\n",
    "outside that ROI). However, in cross-subject analyses it is often helpful to\n",
    "maintain the same data dimensionality for all subjects, and there is no\n",
    "guarantee that the same channels will be bad for all subjects. It is possible\n",
    "in such cases to remove each channel that is bad for even a single subject,\n",
    "but that can lead to a dramatic drop in data rank (and ends up discarding a\n",
    "fair amount of clean data in the process). In such cases it is desirable to\n",
    "reconstruct bad channels by interpolating its signal based on the signals of\n",
    "the good sensors around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How interpolation works\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpolation of EEG channels in MNE-Python is done using the spherical\n",
    "spline method :footcite:`PerrinEtAl1989`, which projects the sensor\n",
    "locations onto a unit sphere\n",
    "and interpolates the signal at the bad sensor locations based on the signals\n",
    "at the good locations. Mathematical details are presented in\n",
    "`channel-interpolation`. Interpolation of MEG channels uses the field\n",
    "mapping algorithms used in computing the `forward solution\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpolation in MNE-Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpolating bad channels in :class:`~mne.io.Raw` objects is done with the\n",
    ":meth:`~mne.io.Raw.interpolate_bads` method, which automatically applies the\n",
    "correct method (spherical splines or field interpolation) to EEG and MEG\n",
    "channels, respectively (there is a corresponding method\n",
    ":meth:`mne.Epochs.interpolate_bads` that works for :class:`~mne.Epochs`\n",
