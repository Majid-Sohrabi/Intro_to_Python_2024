    "Datasets in MNE-Python:\n",
    "```\n",
    "There are data_path functions for several example datasets in MNE-Python (e.g., mne.datasets.kiloword.data_path(), mne.datasets.spm_face.data_path(), etc). All of them will check the default download location first to see if the dataset is already on your computer, and only download it if necessary. The default download location is also configurable; see the documentation of any of the data_path functions for more information.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in `the introductory tutorial <tut-overview>`, MNE-Python data structures are based around the `.fif` file format from Neuromag. This tutorial uses an `example dataset <sample-dataset>` in `.fif` format, so here we'll use the function `mne.io.read_raw_fif` to load the raw data; there are reader functions for `a wide variety of other data formats <data-formats>` as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also `several other example datasets <datasets>` that can be downloaded with just a few lines of code. Functions for downloading example datasets are in the `mne.datasets` submodule; here we'll use `mne.datasets.sample.data_path` to download the \"`sample-dataset`\" dataset, which contains EEG, MEG, and structural MRI data from one subject performing an audiovisual experiment. When it's done downloading, `~mne.datasets.sample.data_path` will return the folder location where it put the files; you can navigate there with your file browser if you want to examine the files yourself. Once we have the file path, we can load the data with `~mne.io.read_raw_fif`. This will return a `~mne.io.Raw` object, which we'll store in a variable called ``raw``."

    "\n",
    "Methods are like specialized functions attached to an object. Usually they require additional user input and/or need some computation to yield a result. Methods always have parentheses at the end; additional arguments (if any) go inside those parentheses (examples: raw.estimate_rank(), raw.drop_channels(['EEG 030', 'MEG 2242'])).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw above that printing the `~mne.io.Raw` object displays some basic information like the total number of channels, the number of time points at which the data were sampled, total duration, and the approximate size in memory. Much more information is available through the various *attributes* and *methods* of the `~mne.io.Raw` class. Some useful attributes of `~mne.io.Raw` objects include a list of the channel names (`~mne.io.Raw.ch_names`), an array of the sample times in seconds (`~mne.io.Raw.times`), and the total number of samples (`~mne.io.Raw.n_times`); a list of all attributes and methods is given in the documentation of the `~mne.io.Raw` class.\n",

    "### The ``Raw.info`` attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also quite a lot of information stored in the ``raw.info`` attribute, which stores an `~mne.Info` object that is similar to a `Python dictionary <dict>` (in that it has fields accessed via named keys). Like Python dictionaries, ``raw.info`` has a ``.keys()`` method that shows all the available field names; unlike Python dictionaries, printing ``raw.info`` will print a nicely-formatted glimpse of each field's data. See `tut-info-class` for more on what is stored in `~mne.Info` objects, and how to interact with them."
